# network-scanner
Automated network change IP scanning script
This script scans the network using a pre-entered IP list for any changes
New IPs detected and IPs removed are returned as output in the application
The script uses Nmap to perform a network scan (not inclusive of ports)

To install nmap module in Python, you can open up terminal and input "pip install nmap"
Alternatively, if the above fails, you can open up windows command prompt and navigate to Python scripts folder by inputting the following:

>cd C:\Users\Asus\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts

Once directory is set, you can now install nmap module by inputting the command:

> pip install nmap

Once nmap is installed successfully, you can now run the script without errors
